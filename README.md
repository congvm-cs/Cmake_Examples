# How to use CMake to compile C/C++ project

In this project, I provided a straightforward set of "Introduction of using CMake" for build C++ projects. All steps are tested on my Ubuntu 18.04 laptop.

The `make` utility and `Makefiles` provide a build system that can be used to manage the compilation and re-compilation of programs that are written in any programming language. Makefiles become overly complex for huge task.

Building complex projects is where `CMake` shines. CMake is a cross-platform Makefiles generator! Simply, __CMake automatically generates the Makefiles for your projects__.
